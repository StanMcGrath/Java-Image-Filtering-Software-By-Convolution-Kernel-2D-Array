# Java-Image-Filtering-Software-By-Convolution-Kernel-2D-Array
This programme filters images by convolution kernel matrices using 2D arrays in Java.

This folder contains the SRC and bin folders of the project in which reside the Java classes and code.

//////////////

HOW TO RUN

//////////////

Via the command prompt on your OS (cmd on Windows), navigate to the bin directory of the Programme and run the following command to excecute the JAR file:

java -cp ./ImageFilter.jar ie.gmit.hdip.Runner

//////////////

TO DO

//////////////

This Programme represented an introductory venture into a Java OOP Project of larger scale. As such, it contains much duplicate code (each of the Kernel classes hold the same code apart from their specific convolution kernel matrices). These classes should be re-done to contain only the kernel code which is to be passed in as parameter to a single Kernel Class, in adherance to stronger OOP abstraction principles.
